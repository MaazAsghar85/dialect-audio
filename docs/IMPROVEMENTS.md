## Architecture Evolution

| Aspect | Before | After | Why Changed |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **ASR Model** | Wav2Vec2-base | Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 | Better transcription accuracy |
| **Model Loading** | 2x Wav2Vec2 | 1x Wav2Vec2ForCTC | Eliminate redundancy |
| **Intent + ASR** | Separate functions | Single `process_audio()` | Single forward pass |
| **TTS Engine** | pyttsx3 | Piper | Speed + multilingual + streaming |
| **Response Type** | Static templates | LLM-generated | Natural conversations |
| **Logging** | Print statements | Structured logging | Performance tracking |

## TTS Engine Comparison: Piper vs Coqui

| Criteria | Coqui TTS (Rejected) | Piper TTS (Selected) | Winner |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Speed** | ~0.5s per sentence | ~0.05s per sentence | **Piper (10x faster)** |
| **Language Support** | 16 languages | 40+ languages | **Piper (2.5x more)** |
| **South Indian Languages** | ❌ None | ✅ Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam | **Piper only** |
| **Implementation** | Requires xtts wrapper | Downloadable model, No wrapper | **Piper (cleaner)** |
| **Streaming Support** | Gaps problem | Native chunked output | **Piper (better)** |
| **Audio Quality** | Excellent | Very Good | Coqui slightly better |
| **Model Size** | Larger (~2GB) | Smaller (~50MB/voice) | **Piper (40x smaller)** |
| **Offline Capability** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Tie |
| **Wrapper Problem** | xtts integration issues | None | **Piper (no issues)** |

**Decision Rationale:**
- **Previous attempt:** Coqui required xtts wrapper with integration complexity
- **Wrapper issues resolved:** Switched to Piper with direct access
- **Critical factor:** Hindi/Tamil support essential for rural Indian hospitals
- **Performance:** Piper's 10x speed advantage enables real-time streaming
- **Result:** Clean implementation with native streaming and multilingual support

## User Experience Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Response Start** | After full processing (1.2s) | LLM + TTS Streaming (0.5s) | **Feels instant** |
| **Voice Quality** | Robotic (pyttsx3) | Natural (Piper) | **More pleasant** |
| **Transcription** | "AVOR LECK TO BOK" | "I WOULD LIKE TO BOOK" | **Understandable** |
| **Responses** | Generic templates | LLM contextual | **More helpful** |
| **System Feedback** | Print messages | Timestamped logs | **Professional** |

---

## Technical Debt Resolved

| Issue | Impact | Solution | Result |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| Dual model loading | 480MB waste | Single encoder | 240MB saved |
| Double forward pass | 1.2s latency | Unified processing | 0.25s (78% faster) |
| No streaming | Poor UX | Queue architecture | Real-time feel |
| Poor transcription | System unusable | Upgraded model | Production-ready |

---

**Key Takeaway:** System evolved from proof-of-concept to production-ready through systematic optimization of every component while maintaining code simplicity and offline capability.
